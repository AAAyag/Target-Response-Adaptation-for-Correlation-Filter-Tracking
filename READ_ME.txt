This is a MATLAB implementation on the adaptive target for correlation filters.
The framework is generic and can be directly implemented in any correlation tracker that
solves the following objective. ||Ax - b||_2^2 + \lambda ||x||_2^2.

It is free for research use. If you find it useful, please acknowledge the paper above with a reference.
